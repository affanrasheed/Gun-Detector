# Gun-Detector
## Description
In this project, a gun detector will be implemented by training a pretrained yolov8n model on a custom dataset and a custom model will be validated and deployed on Jetson Orin Nano using deepstream.
## Stages
### Training
In this stage, a custom [dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/phillip-lavrador/70k-guns/dataset/5) for guns will be used to fine-tune a pretrained yolov8n model.
### Validation 
In this stage, a custom model will be validated on test set of images.
### Testing
In this stage, a model will be tested on multiple test videos.
### Deployment
In this stage, a custom model will be deployed on jetson orin nano using deepstream
